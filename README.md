## Introduction

Spam emails are a common nuisance, and filtering them out is essential for maintaining productivity and security. This project uses a simple yet effective machine learning approach to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The Naive Bayes algorithm is used due to its efficiency and effectiveness in text classification tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
